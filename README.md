# Student Engagement and Retention Analysis – 365 Data Science
# Project context
Personal data analysis project examining student engagement, retention, learning behaviour, and conversion on the 365 Data Science online learning platform. The project targets general stakeholders and decision-makers interested in product performance, user behaviour, and growth strategy.
# Business problems and goals
The platform aims to increase daily student engagement and improve conversion from free to paid subscriptions. This analysis evaluates how students interact with content, how long they remain active, how free and paid users differ, and which platform initiatives influence engagement and retention.
# Dataset details
Real behavioural data from 365 Data Science covering January 2022 to October 2022. The dataset includes student engagement events, learning activity, subscriptions, exams, certificates, course metrics, and career track progression across multiple relational tables.
# Definitions and metrics
Engagement: Any lecture, quiz, or exam interaction

Onboarding: First recorded engagement after registration

Completion rate: Minutes watched divided by course length

Free-plan user: No paid subscription

Paying user: Active monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription
# Methodology
SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and feature engineering. Tableau was used to build a five-page interactive dashboard featuring KPIs, time-series analysis, cohort tables, retention curves, and funnel analysis.
# Exploratory data analysis
Initial analysis focused on onboarding rates, engagement trends over time, differences between free and paid users, learning intensity, exam activity, and certificate issuance.
# Key Insights
Daily engagement increased steadily throughout 2022, reaching ~400 active users per day by October

Free users dominate engagement, but conversion increases sharply after 1–2 hours of content consumption

Gamification and marketing campaigns significantly improved onboarding and engagement

Paid users show strong early retention, stabilising at ~30% over time

Career track completion rates are low, with major drop-off before the first exam
# Recommendations
Introduce guided onboarding with personalised course recommendations

Test limited-time full-access trials for new users

Retarget newly registered users within their first 30 days

Expand gamification and social learning features
